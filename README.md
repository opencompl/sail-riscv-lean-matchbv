# RISC-V ISA Semantics for Lean

These semantics are generated from the official RISC-V SPEC available at
https://github.com/riscv/sail-riscv/.

⚠️ While this repository covers the full RISC-V SPEC, our Lean backend for sail
is still work-in-progress. As a result, our semantics are still full of warnings
and errors. Similarly, our output is not yet polished for readability.
